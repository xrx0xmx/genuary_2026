Self portrait. For example, get started with a very basic human face, a few circles or oval shapes. How far can you improve this by adding features that actually look like you. Try adding eyes, eyelashes, hair, and make a few parameters or colors variable. Even though you are aiming for a self portrait, it might be fun to render some random variations as well.
